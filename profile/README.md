# Operational Genomics  
### The Cognitive Architecture for Industry 5.0

Operational Genomics is a discipline founded by **Carlos Eduardo Favini** that unifies 
**data, artificial intelligence and intentional action** into a coherent, evolutive and 
explainable operational framework.

It introduces:

- **Praxeological Codons** – the atomic units of purposeful action  
- **Operational Genes** – functional sequences that encode processes  
- **Digital Genomes** – complete operational knowledge organisms  
- **Cognitive Cores** – neuro-symbolic reasoning engines  
- **UNL – Universal Neutral Language** – human intention as first-class input  
- **Federated Digital Organisms** – evolutive, purpose-driven operational entities
